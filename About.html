          <h1 class="homeTitle">Meet Sandra</h1>
      <img class = "bio" src="./images/Nana.jpg" alt="">
      <h2 class="mission">Sandra, also affectionately known as "Nana", has been taking care of pets ever since she was a little girl. One faitful day,<br><br> she found a lost kitten on the street near her elementary school and just knew she had to take her home and fix her up<br><br> as best she could. Sadly, after a few weeks she wasn't able to keep the kitten but she knew just the neighbor that<br><br> could! Thankfully she was still able to visit and play with her feline friend, "Molasses" every day and she quickly learned<br><br> that the bond between her family, and her neighbors, had only grown stronger! The spark inside of her heart became<br><br> an inextinguishable fire, and she dedicated the rest of her life to helping animals. At the tender age of 70 years young, <br><br>she's got no signs of stopping! <br><br> Let's meet the rest of the family!
      
      </h2>


          <h1 class="homeTitle">Meet Carolyn</h1>
      <img class = "bio" src="./images/Mom.png" alt="">
      <h2 class="mission">To say that Sandra's oldest Daughter, Carolyn, is a wiz in the kitchen, would be putting it lightly. After graduating from<br><br> the Midwest Culinary Institute, and doing some much needed traveling around the globe, she decided to come back <br><br> home and embark (get it?) on a new challenge! She created a line of gourmet, organic dog treats, for the family pet<br><br> store! You'll see all kinds of cupcakes, doughnuts and delectable treats for your furry loved ones, in our Shop section!</h2>

      <h1 class="homeTitle">Meet Jacqueline</h1>
      <img class="bio" src="./images/Auntie.png" alt="">
      <h2 class="mission">As the old saying goes, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Jacqueline has worked for nearly 20 years as a groomer!<br><br> Whether it's cats or  dogs, you name it, she'll groom it! A big part of rehabilitation for our animals is making sure they're<br><br> healthy and clean! Matted fur can cause animals bloodclots or even provide a nest for ticks and fleas. Jacqueline's<br><br> mission is to make sure that the animal that you choose is just as cute as the day they were born.</h2>

      <h1 class="homeTitle">Meet Ava</h1>
      <img class= "bio" src="./images/Ava.png" alt="">
      <h2 class="mission">Sandra's granddaughter Ava may be the baby of the family, but she's got a heart that's full grown. At 13 years old,<br><br>she's already making waves as an animal rights activist, with both online campaigns, and if need be, in person protests!<br><br> She's never afraid to fight for what she believes in, and she'll certainly tell you herself! Nana couldn't be more proud!</h2>
